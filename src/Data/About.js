        "Innovation is in our DNA. We are proud to have designed solutions that were industry firsts. For example, our team developed one of the first Content Management Systems around the turn of the millennium, we implemented technology used to launch and operate one of the first internationalized (multi-lingual) domain names in the world. Our team was involved with the first commercial test of mobile OCR technology for mobile ticketing in North America.",

Thatâ€™s why, in 2017, we started a formal AI and ML department. This allows us to offer not only product development but also comprehensive <a href='https://integrio.net/artificial-intelligence' target='_blank'>artificial intelligence</a> and data science services to help our clients maintain a competitive edge."
